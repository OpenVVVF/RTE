/**
 * @brief Offline Ld/Lq estimation via DC-biased AC signal injection.
 *
 * Implements the biased-AC standstill method (see Rafaq & Jung, "A
 * Comprehensive Review of State-of-the-Art Parameter Estimation Techniques
 * for PMSMs", IEEE TII 2020, Section III-B, and references [70]-[72]):
 *
 *   - The rotor is held at standstill by a d-axis alignment current (no
 *     torque is produced when the current frame is aligned with the rotor
 *     d-axis, so no shaft clamp is needed).
 *   - A small AC current is superimposed on a DC bias that sets the magnetic
 *     operating point; the differential (incremental) inductance at that
 *     bias is extracted from the AC voltage/current ratio at the injection
 *     frequency:  L = sqrt(|Z|^2 - R^2) / omega,  |Z| = |V_ac| / |I_ac|.
 *   - The DC bias is swept to produce an Ld(Id) saturation curve.  Lq is
 *     measured at zero q-bias (free rotor) and optionally at alternating
 *     +/-Iq bias levels with a rotor-movement guard.
 *
 * Everything runs in closed-loop current control (FOC): the current is the
 * controlled variable, so VSI nonlinearities do not pollute the estimate.
 * The AC component of the measured dq currents and commanded dq voltages is
 * extracted with a Goertzel (single-bin DFT) accumulator running in the FOC
 * PWM ISR via FocControlManager's sample callback.
